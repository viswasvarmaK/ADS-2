Here we go with 3way Quick sort because the time complexity is 1.39WNlog(R) and space complexity is 1.39Nlog(N)
R = radix N = length of string.W = fixed length
In MSD sort we call more number of partitions and at the same time the time complexity is 2W(N+R)
In LSD sort the time complexity is 2W(N+R)
keeping time complexities into considerations we go for 3way Qucik sort
Moveover 3way Quick sort takes only three partions.
